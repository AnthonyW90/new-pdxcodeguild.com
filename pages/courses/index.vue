      <p>
        PDX Code Guild works with a variety of organizations to provide
        financial aid for our students. Over half of our students have qualified
        for partial financial aid through the organizations we partner with.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Because the criteria our partners use differ from organization to
        organization, we encourage you to complete your application as soon as
        possible so that our partners can start working with you.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        PDX Code Guild also offers a limited number of diversity discounts per
        class, based on merit and need, to women, people of color and people who
        are LGBTQ.
